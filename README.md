# House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project

This project predicts house prices using Machine Learning techniques based on several housing features.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and evaluate different regression models to accurately predict house prices and deploy the best-performing model through a simple graphical user interface (GUI).

## 🧠 Features Used
- Number of bedrooms  
- Number of bathrooms  
- Living area  
- Condition of the house  
- Number of nearby schools  

## ⚙ Models Implemented
- Linear Regression  
- Decision Tree Regressor (Best Model)  
- Random Forest Regressor  

The *Decision Tree Regressor* achieved the highest *R² score*, making it the most suitable model for this dataset due to its ability to handle non-linear relationships.

## 🛠 Libraries & Tools
- Python  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  

## 📊 Model Evaluation
- R² Score  
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  

## 🖥 GUI
A simple GUI was developed to allow users to input house features and instantly receive predicted prices.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add location-based features  
- Improve the GUI design  
- Experiment with advanced models such as Gradient Boosting  

## 🔗 Dataset
House Price India Dataset
